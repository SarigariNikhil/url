��# url

<h3>Steps Follows</h3>

<strong>Index.php contains a submit which on submit uses the post method to do action in Shortner.php file.</strong>

Shortener.php file returns the short_url only if the url exists. It prompts error if any error occured in the file.

short_url is generated by using a inbuilt php uniqueId() function. Any how if the uniqueid mathches with others, we prompt the error message.

<strong>The short_url is of the format https://CDN/i?XXXXXX. Here CDN is the Custom Domain Name and XXXXXX - is the 6 digit short-code generated. With this we can easily make short_url of length about 18 characters with Custom Domain Name  which is always fixed.</strong>
  
The whole shorlUrl is sent to the index.php file. Now the index.php file Shows the url and also contains a copy button. 

<strong>It contains Another form that uses the POST method to action in the same file.It will Generate a List of all the URL's that were shortened which also contains the count of no. of times it was used</strong>
