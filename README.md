��# url

Index.php contains a submit which on submit uses the post method to redirect to the Shortner.php file.
Shortener.php file returns the short_url only if the url exists. It prompts error if any error occured in the file.
short_url is generated by using a inbuilt php uniqueId() function. Any how if the uniqueid mathches with others, we prompt the error message.
The short_url is of the format https://CDN/i?XXXXXX. Here CDN is the Custom Domain Name and XXXXXX - is the 6 digit short-code generated. 
With this we can easily make short_url of length about 18 characters with Custom Domain Name  which is always fixed.
The whole shorlUrl is sent to the index.php file. Now the index.php file Shows the url and also contains a copy button. 
It contains Another form that uses the POST method to redirect to the same file.
